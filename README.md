# Hi, I'm Jumski 👋

**Building [pgflow](https://pgflow.dev) full-time** - a Postgres-native workflow engine purpose-built for Supabase.

For the last several months, I've been focused on one thing: turning Supabase primitives - **Queues** and **Edge Functions** - into a **declarative, deeply integrated orchestration layer**. pgflow lets you build reliable, multi-step, parallel logic using a type-safe TypeScript DSL, all without introducing new infrastructure.

---

### 🔧 Background

* 18 years building production-grade web systems (Ruby on Rails, APIs, databases)
* Switched to **Supabase + TypeScript** 2 years ago to explore simpler, Postgres-first architectures
* Obsessed with using databases as durable, expressive business logic engines

---

### 🚧 What I'm Building

* 🚀 [pgflow](https://pgflow.dev): a SQL-native orchestration layer for Supabase projects, featuring:

  - ACID-compliant, pure SQL based execution engine that orchestrates task queues (PGMQ) and workers
  * Edge Worker - a serverless task queue worker handling execution, retries/backoffs, and concurrency control
  * Declarative TypeScript DSL with strong DX for complex workflows
  - CLI Tools for working with the flow definitions
  - Client Library that uses Supabase Realtime to stream excecution status to browser (Work in progress!)
  - Great documentation and exceptional developer experience

---

### 🤝 Let's Collaborate

I'm open to working with:

* Teams building on Supabase who want:
  * Early access to pgflow
  * Help implementing non-trivial workflows
  * Direct input into the roadmap via tight feedback loops

* Developer tools companies focused on improving developer experience:
  * Building intuitive, powerful developer tools
  * Creating systems that prioritize great UX for engineers
  * Delivering simple solutions to complex problems

---

### 💡 Interests

* Developer experience and tooling - creating systems developers love to use
* High-level system design and orchestration patterns
* Functional programming (esp. Clojure)
* Using relational databases as execution environments

---

**No CV. No LinkedIn. Just code, docs, and shipping.**

Let's build resilient workflows - directly in your database.
