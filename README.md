# Hi, I'm Jumski üëã

**Building [pgflow](https://pgflow.dev) full-time** - a Postgres-native workflow engine purpose-built for Supabase.

For the last several months, I've been focused on one thing: turning Supabase primitives - **Queues** and **Edge Functions** - into a **declarative orchestration layer built entirely on Supabase primitives**. pgflow lets you build reliable, multi-step, parallel logic using a type-safe TypeScript DSL, all without introducing new infrastructure.

### üîß Background

- 18 years building production-grade web systems (Ruby on Rails, APIs, databases)
- Switched to **Supabase + TypeScript** 2 years ago to explore simpler, Postgres-first architectures
- Obsessed with using databases as durable, expressive business logic engines

---

### üöß What I'm Building

- üöÄ [pgflow](https://pgflow.dev): a Postgres-native workflow engine featuring:
  - ACID-compliant SQL execution engine built on top of PGMQ
  - Serverless Edge Worker for handling task execution, retries, and concurrency
  - Type-safe DSL in TypeScript for defining workflows
  - CLI for managing flow definitions and migrations
  - Realtime client library (WIP) for streaming execution state to the frontend
  - High-quality documentation and exceptional developer experience

---

### ü§ù Let's Collaborate

I'm open to working with:

- Teams building on Supabase who want:
  - Early access to pgflow
  - Help implementing non-trivial workflows
  - Direct input into the roadmap via tight feedback loops

- Developer tools companies focused on improving developer experience:
  - Building intuitive, powerful developer tools
  - Creating systems that prioritize great UX for engineers while being simple, flexible, and robust
  - Delivering elegant solutions to complex problems

---

### üí° Interests

- Developer experience and tooling - creating systems developers love to use
- High-level system design and orchestration patterns
- Functional programming (esp. Clojure)
- Using relational databases as execution environments
- Technical writing and documentation - crafting clear, comprehensive guides

---

**Open to conversations about developer experience and tooling.**

Let's build resilient workflows - directly in your database.
